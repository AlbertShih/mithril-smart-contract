# smart-contract
The smart contract that we use.

## Mithril Token contract
**The Safest, Simplest ERC20 standard token contract you ever seen that was deployed on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3893b9422cd5d70a81edeffe3d5a1c6a978310bb)**

### Features
- The max gaslimit when token transfer is **54500** which is extremely low even the first time address being used.
- The Simplest SafeMath library. There are only 2 methods, `sub` and `add`.
- Empty constructor. It cannot be changed forever once initialized.
